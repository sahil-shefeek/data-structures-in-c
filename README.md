## Navigation

Navigating through a repository can be challenging, but my repository is designed with meticulous organization to make navigation easy and intuitive.

The file structure of data-structures-in-c is structured according to a clear navigational hierarchy. Below is an overview of this hierarchy, arranged from the highest to the lowest level of importance:

| Precedence Level |               Data Structure               |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|        1         |                   Arrays                   |
|        2         |                Linked List                 |
|       2.1        |             Singly Linked List             |
|       2.2        |             Doubly Linked List             |
|        3         |                   Queue                    |
|        4         |                   Stack                    |
|        5         |                    Tree                    |
|        6         | Default (Anything Not Otherwise Mentioned) |

Each navigational precedence level has its own dedicated directory or folder.
Certain levels (2.1, 2.2) are closely related that they have one parent folder with sub folders showing individual levels.

### Example Usage

Let's imagine you're looking a program that involves three key elements:

a) Linked List,
b) implemented using Arrays

In this scenario, you can efficiently navigate the repository's structure as follows:

1. **Linked List**: Begin by exploring the **_linked list_** directory since linked list has a higher precedence.

2. **Arrays**: After reviewing linked list, proceed to the **_Arrays_** directory as it has the next highest precedance.

By following this path, you will navigate through: **linked_list > arrays > program.c**

## How to run?

To use the programs in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). Follow these steps to get started:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/sahil-shefeek/data-structures-in-c.git


    ```

2.  Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:

    ```shell
    cd ccpy



    ```

3.  Compile and run any program using your preferred C compiler. For example, to compile and run the program named `program.c`, use the following commands:

    ```shell
    gcc program.c
    ./a.out
    ```

    For Windows users:

        gcc program.c
        a.exe

Each program in this repository is contained in its own file with a descriptive name. To use a specific program, follow these steps:

1. Open the program file (e.g., `program.c`) using a text editor of your choice.

2. Read the comments and code to understand the purpose and functionality of the program.

3. Modify the code as needed or use it as a reference for your own projects.

4. Save the changes and follow the installation instructions mentioned above to compile and run the program.
